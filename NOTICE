================================================================================

This derivative work includes the following modifications from the original:

1. Complete rewrite in Go (original was TypeScript/Node.js)
2. Removed interactive/TUI mode - non-interactive only
3. Simplified authentication - OAuth token reuse only (no new login flow)
4. Retained MCP (Model Context Protocol) client support
5. Retained ~/.gemini/settings.json compatibility

The authentication tokens and configuration files from the original Gemini CLI
(located in ~/.gemini/) are reused by this tool for convenience.
